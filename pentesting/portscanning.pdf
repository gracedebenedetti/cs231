1. Passive information gathering:
    a) What domain did you investigate? friendsbalt.org
    b) What is its IP address? 54.209.77.18
    c) When does the domain's registration expire? June 6th, 2025
    d) What information, if any, did you learn about the people or corporation responsible for the domain in question? We learned the organization, got some contact information and a summary of how we registered to gain this information. We got information of the whois server, but when we use the whois website, "Statutory Masking Enabled" for most of the information.

2. Host Detection:
    a) List the IP addresses for all the active hosts you found on the local network: 10.0.2.1, 10.0.2.2, 10.0.2.4, 10.0.2.15
    b) What entities do those IP addresses represent? 10.0.2.1: router (default ip), 10.0.2.2: default gateway for virtualBox, 10.0.2.4: Metasploitable (private ip address), 10.0.2.15: Virtual Machine (this is the default gateway for guest virtual machines)
    c) For each possible candidate IP address it was searching in the local network, what steps did nmap take? The local host broadcasts to all possible local ip addresses from 10.0.2.0 to 10.0.2.255 by sending an ARP protocol request saying "who has 10.0.2.# tell 10.0.2.15". If The IP address is active on the local network, it will send back a TCP protocol message with ACK flags.
    d) Same question, but for the 137.22.4.0/24 network. 137.22.4.5: elegit.mathcs.edu , 137.22.4.17: perlman.mathcs.carleton.edu, 137.22.4.19: ada.mathcs.carleton.edu, 137.22.4.146: mtietest2.mathcs.carleton.edu, 137.22.4.175: awb1.mathcs.carleton.edu, we also found 137.22.4.20 and 137.22.4.20 but using nslookup did not work. We could find that these two addresses had carle.net as their providers and were located in the central time zone. Our local host sent SYN messages to every ip address on carleton's mathcs network, and waited to see if it was an active ip address by receiving an ACK message in response.

3. Port Scanning:
    a) Which ports does Metasploitable have open, and what services do they correspond to (e.g. port 22 / SSH or port 80 / HTTP)?
        These are all the ports that 10.0.2.4 has open:
        PORT     STATE SERVICE
        21/tcp   open  ftp
        22/tcp   open  ssh
        23/tcp   open  telnet
        25/tcp   open  smtp
        53/tcp   open  domain
        80/tcp   open  http
        111/tcp  open  rpcbind
        139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
        445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
        512/tcp  open  exec
        513/tcp  open  login
        514/tcp  open  shell
        1099/tcp open  rmiregistry
        1524/tcp open  ingreslock
        2049/tcp open  nfs
        2121/tcp open  ccproxy-ftp
        3306/tcp open  mysql
        5432/tcp open  postgresql
        5900/tcp open  vnc
        6000/tcp open  X11
        6667/tcp open  irc
        8009/tcp open  ajp13
        8180/tcp open  unknown

    b) What database server(s) is/are available on Metasploitable? mysql and postgresql. I think ingreslock is a database itself, but not a database server?
    c) What is the value of the RSA SSH host key? What is the host key for? host key: 56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3 The host key is used for authentication. It verifies that the client is connecting to the correct host using an RSA key pair.
    d) Pick one of the open ports that has a service you have never heard of, and explain what the service does.
        port 445-- microsoft-ds is a port with type SMB which stands for Server Message Block. SMB is a protocol used mostly by window servers to give shared access to files and other items such as printers over a network and can also remotely execute commands.
