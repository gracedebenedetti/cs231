===== DAYTIME =====
1. Identify the parts of the TCP 3-way handshake by listing the frame summaries of the relevant frames. Your summaries should looks something like this: 3  10.0.2.15  129.6.15.27  TCP  [SYN]...
- 1 10.0.2.15 129.6.15.29 TCP [SYN] ...
- 2 129.6.15.29 10.0.2.15 TCP [SYN][ACK] ...
- 3 10.0.2.15 129.6.15.27  TCP [ACK]

2. What port number does the client (i.e. nc on your Kali computer) use for this interaction? And why does the client need a port?
-The client uses port 50724. The client needs a port because it is using that port to tell the server where to send the information.

3. What frame contains the actual date and time? (Show the frame summary as in question 1 above.)
- Frame 4: 4 129.6.15.29 10.0.2.15 DAYTIME DAYTIME Response ...

4. What is the full content (not counting the Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers) of the frame? What do each of the pieces of the frame content represent? (Most of the frame content is things like the year, month, day, hour, etc., but there's a little more info, too.)
- Full content of the frame: \n59308 21-04-04 19:11:07 50 0 0 10.5 UTC(NIST) * \n

5. What does [SYN] mean?
- [SYN] means the opening of the connection and asking if you can talk
6. What does [ACK] mean?
-[ACK] shows the acknowledging of the response
7. What does [FIN] mean?
-[FIN] means the ending of the connection

8. Which entity (the nc client or the daytime server) initiated the closing of the TCP connection? How can you tell?
-The daytime server initialized the closing of the TCP connection because the first instance of [FIN] came from the source with the daytime server's IP address.

===== HTTP =====
1. How many TCP connections were opened?
-There were two TCP connections opened. Only two connections had only [SYN].

2. Can you tell where my homepage (index.html) was requested? (If not, why not? If so, include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your answer.)
- The homepage was requested in frame 5. 5 10.0.2.15 45.79.89.123 [HTTP] GET /index.html HTTP/1.1

3. Can you tell where my photograph (jeff_square_head.jpg) was requested? (If not, why not? If so, include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your answer.)
- The photo was requested in frame 11. 11 10.0.2.15 45.79.89.123 [HTTP] GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1

===== QUESTIONS =====
1. What does the full response from the daytime server mean? What do all the other numbers mean other than the date and time?
2. What does [PSH] mean?
3. What is the need for all the different servers that all have to [ACK]?
