1. What's your computer's IP address for its current Internet connection? (Bonus: how can you tell the difference between your Ethernet IP and your wireless IP if you have both connections active?)
    IP address: 137.22.166.158 for eduroam
    I think ethernet addresses have colons between the sections of numbers and letters whereas the IP addresses have periods and only have numbers.

2. How can you determine the IP address associated with a given host name?
    Use the ping command with the host name. In the terminal, type ping [host name] and it will output the IP address for the given host name.
    I typed "ping Graces-MacBook-Pro-2.local"
    and got the output 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.043 ms

3. How can you determine the host name(s) associated with a given IP address?
    nslookup command in the terminal will give the host name. Type nslookup [IP address]. I typed: "nslookup 137.22.166.158" and got the output:
    Server:		137.22.198.40
    Address:	137.22.198.40#53

    158.166.22.137.IN-ADDR.ARPA	name = eduroam-166-158.dyn.carleton.edu.

4. How can you copy a file from one computer to another? Or more to the point, if you create a file on the Kali virtual machine and you want to put it someplace where you can save it, like your your Math/CS account on mantis.mathcs.carleton.edu, how do you go about it from the Kali command-line interface?
    scp [location of file] [destination for file]
    Where the location contains the [name of the account on the host computer]@[hostname where file is]:[name of directory of source file]/[filename]
    And destination contains [name of the account on the destination computer]@[hostname where file will be sent]:[name of directory where copy will go]/[copy filename]

5. How can you tell whether there's a process listening on a given port (e.g. port 80 or port 22) on a given host?
    lsof -i :[port number] will output what is listening or nothing if the port is not listening.

6. How can you tell which ports have processes listening on them on a given host?
    sudo lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN This command gives a list of all listening ports.

7. How can you retrieve and save a given web page (say http://google.com/ or http://carleton.edu/) in a file on your system?
    wget -O "[url]" [filename] will retrieve and save a given web page in a file on my system labeled with the given filename

8. How can you view the HTTP headers sent back from a specified web server when you request one of its pages?
    curl -IL [url] will output the response headers. I believe if you leave out the I and just do -L it will be all headers.

    There were two more options that I didn't quite understand, but I will list them too: wget -s and telnet

9. [Super bonus question] Is there a command-line-only way to view the HTTP headers that *my* computer sends when I run the commands in the previous two questions?
    I'm not quite sure about this, but I looked into what a response header is, and then I found request headers. I think that the headers my computer sends are these request headers. The way to find them is by using curl -v [url].
